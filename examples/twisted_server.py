"""
This is a simple SOCKS5 server implementation based on Twisted.
Use it for educational purpose.

USAGE: twisted_server.py [LISTEN_PORT]

This does little error handling and is not designed for production.

Any production ready code should be contributed upstream to Twisted.

Terminology:

* "remote peer" is the peer to which we connect on behalf of the client.
* "client" - is the socks5 client requested this server to connect to the
             remote peer.

Also check proxy65 for a pure Twisted implementation
* https://code.google.com/archive/p/proxy65/ - Original. Google Code is Dead.
